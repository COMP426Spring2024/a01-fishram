            <h2>Medusa</h2>
            <p>Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, was the only mortal among them. Her hair of living, venomous snakes and a gaze that turned anyone who looked into her eyes to stone made her a terrifying figure in Greek mythology.</p>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>Medusa was not always a monster. A curse placed upon her by Athena transformed Medusa's beautiful hair into serpents.</p>
            <h3>Encounter with Perseus</h3>
            <p>Perseus was sent on a quest to bring back the head of Medusa. Using his shield as a mirror, he managed to behead Medusa without looking directly at her.</p>
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Medusa's head was used by Perseus to perform heroic deeds.</li>
                <li>Even after her death, the image of Medusa's head had the power to ward off evil, symbolizing protection.</li>
